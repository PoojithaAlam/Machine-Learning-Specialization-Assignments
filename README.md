# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Specialization â€“ Graded Assignments (Module-wise)

This repository contains graded programming assignments completed as part of the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Andrew Ng on Coursera. The specialization is divided into three courses, each with weekly modules that include hands-on assignments to build core ML skills.

## ðŸ“— Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

### ðŸŸ¢ Module 2: Linear Regression with One Variable
- Implemented linear regression using gradient descent.
- Predicted housing prices based on a single feature (e.g., house size).

### ðŸŸ¢ Module 3: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
- Extended linear regression to multiple features.
- Used feature normalization to improve convergence.

### ðŸŸ¢ Module 4: Logistic Regression
- Built a binary classifier using logistic regression.
- Applied sigmoid function and cost optimization with gradient descent.

### ðŸŸ¢ Module 5: Regularized Linear Regression
- Introduced regularization to reduce overfitting.
- Compared bias vs variance by evaluating model performance on training vs validation sets.
